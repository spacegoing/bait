# PhD Update 2/4/24

- Holiday/sick for past 3 weeks, so not much new progress

- Summary of where I am at:
 
  - End-to-End experiment, which integrates LeanDojo, HOL4, HOList, different search and tactic models, and fine-tuning methods
    - Visualisation, distributed training, managed through configs. So far seems to show progress in the goal of BAIT (enabling rapid experiments)
     
  - Found an improvement with seq2seq finetuning using End-to-End training in LeanDojo
   
  - UpDown with sampling tested, performs worse than BestFS 
    - Test with BestFS using goal model instead of LLM logprob

  - Working on new method based on Thompson Sampling
    - Won't work with UpDown (no natural way to update the posterior)
    - Would integrate better with HTPS 

- Travel to Canberra booked from 6/4/24 to 14/4/24
  - Aim is to work on new search method
  - Possibly better HOL4 environment, if we have time


- TODO
  - Run HTPS experiment before Canberra 
  - Work on progress summary for monitoring
